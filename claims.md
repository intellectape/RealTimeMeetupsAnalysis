### Project Title
Identification and Analysis of popular trends around the world.

### Project Description
In this project, we aim to combine and analyze the real-time data produced by Meetup and Twitter API at a very high speed (120-180 events per minute and ~50 tweets per second). Our analysis include identification of popular trends and choices and the factors on which it is based on a world-level scale.

### Claims
1. The statistical inference can be performed in real time, independent of the velocity of data stream and data size.
2. The two streams can be perfectly synchronized in real time and resources are dynamically scaled according to the stream speed and data size.
3. Combining two streams of data into a meaningful analysis in real-time considering volume of data received and the stream of data.
4. We can use the existing frameworks part of AWS, Kinesis firehose, analytics and S3 to achieve the promised scalability, reliability and reduced latency.

### Underlying technology to be used
1. AWS - S3
2. Kinesis Firehose
3. Spark
4. Hadoop
